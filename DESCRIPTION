Description: A friendly fork of CMAverse that keeps the original workflow and API and adds focused extensions for mediation analysis with the g-formula: (i) additional effect measures for binary outcomes (risk ratio and risk difference, alongside odds ratio); (ii) an option to compute interventional effects via conditional mediator draws; and (iii) clearer effect labelling that switches between natural and randomised-analogue labels when intermediate confounding is specified. Functionality outside 'model = "gformula"' follows CMAverse.
